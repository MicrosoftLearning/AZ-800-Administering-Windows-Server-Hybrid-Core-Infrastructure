# Lab answer key: Implementing identity services and Group Policy

## Exercise 1: Deploying a new domain controller on Server Core

#### Task 1: Deploy AD DS on a new Windows Server Core server

1. Connect to **SEA-ADM1** and, if needed, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.
1. On **SEA-ADM1**, select **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.
1. To install the AD DS server role, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter:
	
   ```powershell
   Install-WindowsFeature –Name AD-Domain-Services –ComputerName SEA-SVR1
   ```
1. To verify that the AD DS role is installed on **SEA-SVR1**, enter the following command, and then press Enter:
	
   ```powershell
   Get-WindowsFeature –ComputerName SEA-SVR1
   ```
1. In the output of the previous command, search for the **Active Directory Domain Services** checkbox, and then verify that it is selected. Then, search for **Remote Server Administration Tools**. Notice the **Role Administration Tools** node below it, and then verify that the **AD DS and AD LDS Tools** node is also selected.

   > **Note**: Under the **AD DS and AD LDS Tools** node, only **Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell** has been installed and not the graphical tools, such as the Active Directory Administrative Center. If you centrally manage your servers, you will not usually need these on each server. If you want to install them, you must specify the AD DS tools by running the **Add-WindowsFeature** cmdlet with the **RSAT-ADDS** command.

   > **Note**: You might need to wait a brief time after the installation process is complete before verifying that the AD DS role has installed. If you do not observe the expected results from the **Get-WindowsFeature** command, you can try again after a few minutes.

#### Task 2: Prepare the AD DS installation and promote a remote server

1.  On **SEA-ADM1**, on the **Start** menu, select **Server Manager**, and then, in **Server Manager**, select the **All Servers** view.
1. On the **Manage** menu, select **Add Servers**.
1. In the **Add Servers** dialog box, maintain the default settings, and then select **Find Now**.
1. In the **Active Directory** list of servers, select **SEA-SVR1**, select the arrow to add it to the **Selected** list, and then select **OK**.
1. On **SEA-ADM1**, ensure that the installation of the AD DS role on **SEA-SRV1** is complete and that the server was added to **Server Manager**. Then select the **Notifications** flag symbol.
1. Note the post-deployment configuration of **SEA-SVR1**, and then select the **Promote this server to a domain controller** link.
1. In the **Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard**, on the **Deployment Configuration** page, under **Select the deployment operation**, verify that **Add a domain controller to an existing domain** is selected.
1. Ensure that the `Contoso.com` domain is specified, and then in the **Supply the credentials to perform this operation** section, select **Change**.
1. In the **Credentials for deployment operation** dialog box, in the **User name** box, enter **CONTOSO\\Administrator**, and then in the **Password** box, enter **Pa55w.rd**.
1. Select **OK**, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Domain Controller Options** page, ensure that the **Domain Name System (DNS) server** and **Global Catalog (GC)** checkboxes are selected. Ensure that the **Read-only domain controller (RODC)** checkbox is cleared.
1. In the **Type the Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password** section, enter and confirm the password **Pa55w.rd**, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **DNS Options** page, select **Next**.
1. On the **Additional Options** page, select **Next**.
1. On the **Paths** page, keep the default path settings for the **Database** folder, **Log files** folder, and **SYSVOL** folder, and then select **Next**.
1. To open the generated Windows PowerShell script, on the **Review Options** page, select **View script**.
1. In Notepad, edit the generated Windows PowerShell script:

   - Delete the comment lines that begin with the number sign (**#**).
   - Remove the **Import-Module** line.
   - Remove the grave accents (**`**) at the end of each line.
   - Remove the line breaks.

1. Now the **Install-ADDSDomainController** command and all the parameters are on one line. Place the cursor in front of the line, and then, on the **Edit** menu, select **Select All** to select the whole line. On the menu, select **Edit**, and then select **Copy**.
1. Switch to the **Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard**, and then select **Cancel**.
1. When prompted for confirmation, select **Yes** to cancel the wizard.
1. At the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command:

   ```powershell
   Invoke-Command –ComputerName SEA-SVR1 { }
   ```
1. Place the cursor between the braces (**{ }**), and then paste the content of the copied script line from the clipboard. The complete command should have the following format:
	
   ```powershell
 	Invoke-Command –ComputerName SEA-SVR1 {Install-ADDSDomainController -NoGlobalCatalog:$false -CreateDnsDelegation:$false -Credential (Get-Credential) -CriticalReplicationOnly:$false -DatabasePath "C:\Windows\NTDS" -DomainName "Contoso.com" -InstallDns:$true -LogPath "C:\Windows\NTDS" -NoRebootOnCompletion:$false -SiteName "Default-First-Site-Name" -SysvolPath "C:\Windows\SYSVOL" -Force:$true}

   ```
1. To invoke the command, press Enter.
1. In the **Windows PowerShell Credential Request** dialog box, enter **CONTOSO\\Administrator** in the **User name** box, enter **Pa55w.rd** in the **Password** box, and then select **OK**.
1. When prompted for the password, in the **SafeModeAdministratorPassword** text box, enter **Pa55w.rd**, and then press Enter.
1. When prompted for confirmation, in the **Confirm SafeModeAdministratorPassword** text box, enter **Pa55w.rd**, and then press Enter.
1. Wait until the command runs and the **Status Success** message is returned. The **SEA-SVR1** virtual machine restarts.
1. Close Notepad without saving the file.
1. After **SEA-SVR1** restarts, on **SEA-ADM1**, switch to **Server Manager**, and on the left side, select the **AD DS** node. Note that **SEA-SVR1** has been added as a server and that the warning notification has disappeared.

   > **Note**: You might have to select **Refresh**.

### Task 3: Manage objects in AD DS

1. Ensure that you are connected to the console session of **SEA-ADM1**.
1. Switch to **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.
1. To create an Organizational Unit (OU) called **Seattle** in the Contoso AD DS domain, enter the following command, and then press Enter:

   ```powershell
   New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name "Seattle" -Path "DC=contoso,DC=com" -ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion $true -Server SEA-DC1.contoso.com
   ```
1. To create a user account for **Ty Carlson** in the **Seattle** OU, enter the following command, and then press Enter:

   ```powershell
   New-ADUser -Name Ty -DisplayName 'Ty Carlson' -GivenName Ty -Surname Carlson -Path 'OU=Seattle,DC=contoso,DC=com'
   ```
1. To set the password for the Ty's user account, enter the following command, and then press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Set-ADAccountPassword Ty
   ```
1. When you receive a prompt for the current password, press Enter.
1. When you receive a prompt for the desired password, enter **Pa55w.rd**, and then press Enter.
1. When you receive a prompt to repeat the password, enter **Pa55w.rd**, and then press Enter.
1. To enable the account, enter the following command, and then press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Enable-ADAccount Ty
   ```
1. To create a domain global group named **SeattleBranchUsers**, enter the following command, and then press Enter:

   ```powershell
   New-ADGroup SeattleBranchUsers -Path 'OU=Seattle,DC=contoso,DC=com' -GroupScope Global -GroupCategory Security
   ```
1. To add the **Ty** user account to the newly created group, enter the following command, and then press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Add-ADGroupMember -Identity SeattleBranchUsers -Members Ty
   ```
1. To confirm that the user is in the group, enter the following command, and then press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Get-ADGroupMember -Identity SeattleBranchUsers
   ```
1. To add the user to the local Administrators group, enter the following command, and then press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Add-LocalGroupMember -Group 'Administrators' -Member 'CONTOSO\Ty'
   ```

   > **Note**: This is necessary to allow sign in with the **CONTOSO\\Ty** user account to **SEA-ADM1**.

**Results**: After this exercise, you should have successfully created a new domain controller and managed objects in AD DS.

## Exercise 2: Configuring Group Policy

#### Task 5: Verify the order of precedence

1. Back in the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, ensure that the **Seattle** OU is selected.
1. Select the **Group Policy Inheritance** tab and review its content.

   > **Note**: The Seattle Application Override GPO has higher precedence than the CONTOSO Standards GPO. The screen saver time-out policy setting that you just configured in the Seattle Application Override GPO is applied after the setting in the CONTOSO Standards GPO. Therefore, the new setting will overwrite the CONTOSO Standards GPO setting. Screen saver time-out will be disabled for users within the scope of the Seattle Application Override GPO.

#### Task 6: Configure the scope of a GPO with security filtering

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, in the **Group Policy Management** console, in the navigation pane, if necessary, expand the **Seattle** OU, and then select the **Seattle Application Override** GPO under the **Seattle** OU.
1. In the **Group Policy Management Console** dialog box, review the following message: **You have selected a link to a Group Policy Object (GPO). Except for changes to link properties, changes you make here are global to the GPO, and will impact all other locations where this GPO is linked.**
