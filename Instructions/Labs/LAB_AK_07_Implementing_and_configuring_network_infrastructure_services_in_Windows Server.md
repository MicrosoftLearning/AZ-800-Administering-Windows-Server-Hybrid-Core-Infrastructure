1. Connect to **SEA-ADM1**, and then, if needed, sign in as **CONTOSO\\Administrator** with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.
1. On **SEA-ADM1**, select **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.

   >**Note**: Perform the next two steps in case you have not already installed Windows Admin Center on **SEA-ADM1**.

1. In the **Windows PowerShell** console, enter the following command, and then press Enter to download the latest version of Windows Admin Center:
	
   ```powershell
   Start-BitsTransfer -Source https://aka.ms/WACDownload -Destination "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\WindowsAdminCenter.msi"
   ```
1. Enter the following command, and then press Enter to install Windows Admin Center:
	
   ```powershell
   Start-Process msiexec.exe -Wait -ArgumentList "/i $env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\WindowsAdminCenter.msi /qn /L*v log.txt REGISTRY_REDIRECT_PORT_80=1 SME_PORT=443 SSL_CERTIFICATE_OPTION=generate"
   ```

   > **Note**: Wait until the installation completes. This should take about 2 minutes.

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, start Microsoft Edge, and then browse to `https://SEA-ADM1.contoso.com`.

   >**Note**: If the link does not work, on **SEA-ADM1**, browse to the **WindowsAdminCenter.msi** file, open the context menu for it, and then select **Repair**. After the repair completes, refresh Microsoft Edge. 

1. If prompted, in the **Windows Security** dialog box, enter the following credentials, and then select **OK**:

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, switch to the **Windows PowerShell** console.
1. In the **Windows PowerShell** console, enter the following command, and then press Enter to test the resolution of the `testapp.treyresearch.net` DNS record:

   ```powershell
   Resolve-DnsName -Server sea-svr1.contoso.com -Name testapp.treyresearch.net
   ```

   > **Note**: Verify that the name resolves to **172.30.99.234**. This is expected, because the IP address of **SEA-ADM1** is no longer within the **HeadOfficeSubnet**. DNS queries originating from the **HeadOfficeSubnet** of **(172.16.10.0/24)** targeting `testapp.treyresearch.net` resolve to **172.30.99.100**. DNS queries from outside of this subnet targeting `testapp.treyresearch.net` resolve to **172.30.99.234**.

   > **Note**: Now change the IP address of **SEA-ADM1** back to its original value.

1. Switch back to the **Ethernet Status** window and select **Properties**.
1. In the **Ethernet Properties** dialog box, select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**, and then select **Properties**.
1. In the **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties** dialog box, change the currently assigned IP address (**172.16.11.11**) to its original value (**172.16.10.11**) and select **OK**.
1. Select **Close** twice.
1. Close all open windows.
